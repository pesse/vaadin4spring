The Vaadin4Spring I18N Extensions
=================================

Internationalization in a Vaadin4Spring application is very much handled by the I18N features of Spring itself.
However, to make it a bit easier to use, the addon provides a helper class, namely [I18N](I18N.java).

The ```I18N``` can be injected into any Spring managed bean and uses the locale of the currently active UI
when looking up messages from the application context.

Example:

```java
 @Autowired
 I18N i18n; 
 ...
 myLabel = new Label(i18n.get("myMessageKey", "My argument"));
```

# Composite Message Source

A composite message source is an implementation of the Spring ```MessageSource``` interface
that resolves messages by querying all beans in the application context that implement the
[MessageProvider](MessageProvider.java) interface. 

The idea behind this is to make it possible to build modular UI applications that all share a single message source.
Each module would have its own message provider, and would use either ```I18N``` or the application context directly
to retrieve localized strings. The modules would be completely separated on a source code level, but during runtime they
would all run inside a single application context.

## Enabling the Composite Message Source

You can enable the composite message source by adding the ```@EnableCompositeMessageSource``` annotation to your
Spring configuration. This will add the message source to your application context.

After this, create as many ```MessageProvider``` beans as you want. You can either implement the interface from
scratch, or use the [ResourceBundleMessageProvider](ResourceBundleMessageProvider.java). The latter reads messages from
resource bundles with a specific basename and encoding (check the JavaDocs for more information).

## Example

In the main application:

```java
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableCompositeMessageSource
@ComponentScan
@Configuration
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
    ...
}
```

In the UI module:

```java
@Configuration
public class MyModule {
    @Bean
    MessageProvider communicationMessages() {
        return new ResourceBundleMessageProvider("mymodule.messages"); // Will use UTF-8 by default
    }
    ...
}
```

Finally a tip: If you are building a modular application, it is good practice to prepend the messages with some kind
of module identifier, for example a Java package name. That way you can avoid naming conflicts when additional modules
are added in the future.

# Experimental Stuff

In addition to the ```I18N``` class, there are also some experimental classes that should be used with care (meaning
they might not work at all, they could change dramatically or even be dropped from future versions of the add-on).
